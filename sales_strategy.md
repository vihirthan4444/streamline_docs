## 2️⃣ WhatsApp Sales Script (The "Walk-in" Follow-up)

"Hi [Owner Name], this is [Your Name] from Streamline POS. 

I noticed your shop is quite busy! We just launched a new POS system that works perfectly even when the Dialog/Mobitel signal is weak.

It shows you exactly how much cash you should have at the end of the shift—no more manual tallying errors.

Can I drop by for 10 minutes tomorrow to show you how it works? No strings attached."
