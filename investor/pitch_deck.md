# 📊 Streamline POS: Investor Pitch Deck

## 🚀 1. The Vision
**Streamline** is the first truly modular, offline-ready POS platform designed specifically for the unique challenges of South Asian (Sri Lankan) businesses. We bridge the gap between expensive enterprise ERPs and unreliable manual bookkeeping.

## 🔴 2. The Problem
- **Unreliable Connectivity:** Most SaaS POS systems fail when the internet is down.
- **Complexity Overload:** Existing software is designed for Western markets, not for a local salon or grocery shop in Matara.
- **Cash Leakage:** Business owners lose 3-5% of revenue due to reconciliation errors and lack of shift auditing.

## 🟢 3. The Solution
- **Offline-First Core:** Full transaction capability without data connection.
- **Modular Engine:** Tenants pay only for what they use (POS, Salon, Inventory).
- **Localized Monetization:** LKR-based pricing starting at 2,500/month.

## 📈 4. Market Opportunity
- **Target:** 1M+ small and medium businesses in Sri Lanka.
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** 100k retail/service shops.
- **Revenue Goal:** With 5,000 "Pro" users at 6,500 LKR/month, potential revenue is **32.5M LKR/month ($100k USD MRR)**.

## 💰 5. Revenue Model
- **Subscription:** Monthly tiers (Free, Starter, Pro).
- **Marketplace:** One-time purchase of Premium Themes and Niche Modules.
- **Fintech (Future):** Integrated payments and micro-lending based on sales data.

## 🛠 6. Traction & Tech
