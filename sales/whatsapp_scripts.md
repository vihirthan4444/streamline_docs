# 📱 Streamline POS: WhatsApp Sales Playbook

## 1. The "Cold Walk-in" Follow-up
**Context:** Use this after you briefly visit a shop and get the owner's number.

"Hi [Owner Name], this is [Your Name] from Streamline. It was great meeting you at [Shop Name] earlier today.

I'm sending over that 1-minute demo video I mentioned. As we discussed, even when Dialog/Mobitel signal is down, your POS will keep working perfectly. No more manual bills! 🧾💪

When would be a good time to set up your free trial? I can help you add your first 10 products in under 5 minutes."

We're looking to help more shop owners in [Area Name] save time on their accounts. If you know anyone who needs a faster, offline POS, let me know!

If they sign up, I'll give you **one month of STARTER/PRO plan for free** as a thank you. 🙏"
